If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean.\n",

    "Mode: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more than two modes (multimodal). If all values in the dataset occur with the same frequency, the dataset is said to have no mode.\n",

    "These measures of central tendency are used to summarize and describe the central or typical value of a dataset. They provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of the data. Depending on the nature of the data and the objectives of the analysis, one or more of these measures may be used to describe the central tendency of the dataset."
